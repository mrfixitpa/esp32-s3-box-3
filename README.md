# ESP32-S3-Box-3 Custom Voice Assistant Display

This repository contains **custom ESPHome configuration files** for the **ESP32-S3-Box-3**, designed for use as a **Home Assistant Voice Assistant satellite**.

The goal of this project is to provide a **clean, minimal, and informative display** by removing unnecessary UI elements and adding useful, always-visible information when the device is idle.

---

## ✨ Features

### 🧼 Clean Display Layout
- Removes the default **top and bottom text boxes (bubbles)**
- Uses **full-screen custom illustrations** for all voice assistant states
- Clean, distraction-free interface designed for wall or desk placement

---

### 🕒 Idle Screen (Clock & Temperature)
When the voice assistant is idle, the display shows:
- A **large, centered digital clock**
- **Indoor temperature** pulled directly from Home Assistant
- Optional **blinking colon**
- Optional **AM/PM indicator** (12-hour mode only)

The display automatically returns to this screen after voice interactions complete.

---

### 🎙️ Voice Assistant Integration
When you say **“Hey Jarvis”**, the display seamlessly switches to full-screen illustrations that reflect the current state:

- **Listening**
- **Thinking**
- **Speaking / Replying**
- **Error / Not Ready**
- **Timer Finished**

Once the response is complete, the display returns to the idle clock screen.

## 📁 Available Configuration Files

> ⚠️ **Important:**  
> These YAML files are **ESPHome package files**, not complete standalone device configurations.  
> They must be **included in or merged with your main ESP32-S3-Box-3 ESPHome YAML** and may require editing before compiling.

### 1️⃣ `esp32-s3-box-3.yaml` — Minimal / Clean Display
- Removes top and bottom text bubbles
- Uses full-screen illustrations only
- No clock or temperature display

**Best for:** users who want a clean, image-only voice assistant display.

---

### 2️⃣ `esp32-s3-box-3_clock.yaml` — Clock & Temperature Display
Includes everything from the minimal version, plus:
- Large idle clock
- Indoor temperature display
- 12h / 24h toggle
- AM/PM toggle (12h mode only)
- Blinking colon with no layout shifting

**Best for:** users who want a useful always-on clock and status display.

## 🖼️ Screen Illustrations (Images)

This project uses **custom full-screen illustrations** to represent the different voice assistant states (idle, listening, thinking, speaking, error, etc.).

### Where the Illustrations Come From
You have two options:

#### Option 1: Use the Included / Community Images
Many users reuse or adapt illustrations from:
- ESPHome Voice Assistant examples
- Community projects (GitHub, Discord, forums)
- Your own custom-designed images

Images should be **exactly 320 × 240 pixels** for best results on the ESP32-S3-Box-3 display.

Supported formats:
- `.png`
- `.jpg`

---

#### Option 2: Create Your Own Images
You can create your own illustrations using tools such as:
- Photoshop
- GIMP
- Figma
- Canva
- AI image generation tools

**Guidelines for best results:**
- Resolution: **320 × 240**
- Orientation: Landscape
- Keep designs simple and high-contrast
- Avoid text near the edges of the screen

---

### Where to Store the Images (Home Assistant)
All illustration images must be uploaded into Home Assistant.

Recommended location:
```
/config/www/voice_assistant_images/
```

Example filenames:
```
idle.jpg
listening.jpg
thinking.jpg
speaking.jpg
error.jpg
```

Once uploaded, reference them in your ESPHome YAML using a URL like:

```yaml
substitutions:
  idle_illustration_file: /local/voice_assistant_images/idle.jpg
  listening_illustration_file: /local/voice_assistant_images/listening.jpg
  thinking_illustration_file: /local/voice_assistant_images/thinking.jpg
  replying_illustration_file: /local/voice_assistant_images/speaking.jpg
```

> **Note:** `/local/` maps to `/config/www/` in Home Assistant.

---

### Common Mistakes
- Using images larger or smaller than 320 × 240
- Incorrect filenames or paths (paths are case-sensitive)
- Uploading images outside `/config/www/`

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Requirements
- ESP32-S3-Box-3
- Home Assistant
- ESPHome installed in Home Assistant
- Existing Home Assistant temperature sensor  
  *(example: `sensor.average_indoor_temperature`)*

---

### Step 1: Choose a Configuration File
- `esp32-s3-box-3.yaml` → clean display only
- `esp32-s3-box-3_clock.yaml` → clock + temperature

---

### Step 2: Add the Package to ESPHome
Reference the file from your main ESPHome device YAML:

```yaml
packages:
  s3_box:
    url: github://YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/esp32-s3-box-3_clock.yaml@<commit_sha>
```

---

### Step 3: Edit Before Compiling (Clock Version Only)

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: homeassistant
    id: avg_indoor_temp
    entity_id: sensor.average_indoor_temperature
    internal: true
```

Replace the entity ID with your own sensor.

---

### Step 4: Compile and Upload
- Click **Install**
- Upload firmware
- Wait for reboot

---

### Step 5: Optional Clock Settings
After flashing, Home Assistant will expose:
- 12h / 24h toggle
- AM/PM toggle

These apply instantly and require no reflashing.
